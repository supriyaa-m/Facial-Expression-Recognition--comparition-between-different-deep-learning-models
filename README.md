# Facial-Expression-Recognition--comparition-between-different-deep-learning-models
Facial expressions are the most visual method to convey emotions.Although human
recognize facial expressions without delay, however expression reorganization by computer is
still a challenge.
Computerized facial emotion recognizer finds it applications in various fields like
market research, video game, testing, enhancing website customization, e-education
development process improvement, software engineering, mental state, identification, security,
automatic counselling systems, lie detection, automotive industry, consumer-based AI, event
feedback research, cyber security, etc.
In recent times deep learning technique for FER has become talk of the town. This
popularity stems from their capability to extract features accurately from the image data, low
power and time consumption, increased robustness and accuracy.
This work concludes the best net as XCEPTION â€“ RESNET V2 which gives a
validation accuracy of 90%. This work also aims at creating its own dataset which includes
nine thousand images.
